What is the fusion of male and female gametes to form a zygote called?
+Fertilization
-Capacitation
-Cleavage
-Ovulation

A zygote contains a total of 46 chromosomes. This is known as the:
+Diploid number
-Haploid number
-Monoploid number
-Gamete number

Where does fertilization typically occur?
+In the ampulla of the fallopian tube
-In the fundus of the uterus
-In the ovary
-In the vagina

How long is the journey for sperm to reach the site of fertilization?
+2-7 hours
-2-7 minutes
-4 hours
-48 hours

The process of removing the glycoprotein coat from the sperm's head to allow fertilization is called:
+Capacitation
-Acrosomal reaction
-Cortical reaction
-Cleavage

Which of the following is a direct result of sperm capacitation?
+Increased sperm motility
-Release of hyaluronidase
-Prevention of polyspermy
-Initiation of the second meiotic division

Which enzyme from the acrosome is essential for penetrating the corona radiata?
+Hyaluronidase
-Pepsin
-Amylase
-Acrosin

The cortical and zona reactions occur after the first sperm enters the oocyte to:
+Prevent polyspermy
-Initiate the first meiotic division
-Increase sperm motility
-Dissolve the corona radiata

The entrance of a sperm into the secondary oocyte triggers which critical event?
+The second meiotic division
-The first meiotic division
-Inhibition of the menstrual cycle
-The acrosomal reaction

What is the term for the repetitive cell divisions of the zygote after fertilization begins?
+Cleavage
-Gastrulation
-Neurulation
-Capacitation

After ovulation, for how long does the secondary oocyte remain viable and capable of being fertilized?
+24 hours
-7 hours
-48 hours
-1 week

The fusion of the male and female pronuclei results in the restoration of the:
+Diploid number of chromosomes
-Haploid number of chromosomes
-Sperm motility
-Corona radiata

Which of the following is NOT a direct result of fertilization?
+Sperm capacitation
-Determination of sex
-Initiation of cleavage
-Restoration of the diploid chromosome number
