The repeated mitotic divisions of the zygote within the zona pellucida are known as:
+Cleavage
-Implantation
-Fertilization
-Blastocyst Formation

According to the memo, the morula is formed when the number of cells reaches the:
+16-cell stage
-one cell stage
-4 cell stage
-8 cell stage

The morula reaches the uterine cavity how many days after fertilization?
+4 days
-3 days
-7 days
-12th day

The outer cell mass of the blastocyst is called the:
+Trophoblast
-Embryoblast
-Blastocele
-Zona pellucida

The inner cell mass of the blastocyst is called the:
+Embryoblast
-Trophoblast
-Cytotrophoblast
-Syncytiotrophoblast

The invasive and phagocytic outer layer of the trophoblast that makes a pit in the endometrium is the:
+Syncytiotrophoblast
-Cytotrophoblast
-Embryoblast
-Trophoblast

The disappearance of which structure is required to allow implantation to begin?
+Zona pellucida
-Decidua
-Fibrin plug
-Blastocele

The normal site of implantation is the upper part of the body of the uterus, mainly in the:
+posterior wall
-anterior wall
-uterine cavity
-ampulla

After implantation, the endometrium of the pregnant uterus is called the:
+Decidua
-Endometrium
-Fundus
-Cervix

The part of the decidua located between the blastocyst and the wall of the uterus is the:
+Decidua basalis
-Decidua capsularis
-Decidua parietalis
-Placenta previa

Implantation that occurs outside the usual site is called:
+ectopic implantation
-normal implantation
-Cleavage
-Hatching

What is the most common site for extrauterine implantation?
+Tubal implantation
-Ovarian pregnancy
-Abdominal implantation
-placenta previa centralis
