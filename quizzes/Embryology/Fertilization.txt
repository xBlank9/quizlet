The normal site of fertilization is:
-Isthmus of uterine tube
-Fimbria of uterine tube
+Ampulla of uterine tube
-Intramural part of uterine tube

All are true concerning fertilization EXCEPT:
-The oocyte completes the second meiotic division just before or during it.
-The sperm has to penetrate the corona radiata and zona pellucida.
-After the sperm penetrates the ovum, the tail degenerates.
+It normally occurs in the ovaries.

Results of fertilization are the following EXCEPT:
-Restoration of the diploid number of chromosomes (46).
-Restoration of the embryo's chromosomal sex.
+Lyses of the zona pellucida.
-None of the above

Concerning fertilization, the following is true EXCEPT:
-Penetration of zona is done by acrosome reaction.
-Capacitation means removal of glycoprotein coat.
-It leads to chromosomal sex determination of the embryo.
+Zona reaction allows the entry of more than one sperm into the ovum.

Concerning fertilization, the following is TRUE:
-Results in determination of foetal sex
-Stimulates cleavage
-The sperm has to penetrate the zona pellucida
+All the above

Where does the process of sperm capacitation take place?
-Within the testes
-Within the male urethra
+Within the female genital tract
-Within the ovum

During fertilization, the cortical reaction aids to:
-Sperm can now enter the egg
+Sperm can no longer enter the egg
-Acrosomes are removed
-The corona radiata forms

The process of sperm capacitation takes place inside the:
-Ovum
-Embryo
-Testes
+Female genital tract

What is the result of the cortical reaction?
-The corona radiata forms
-The zona pellucida forms
-Sperm can now enter the egg
+Sperm can no longer enter the egg

Which of the following statements about the embryonic period is true?
-It lasts from fertilization to the end of the first month.
+It lasts from the 3rd to the end of the 8th week.
-It is the longest period of prenatal development.
-It involves only cell growth, not differentiation.

About two hundred sperms reach the site of fertilization. These sperms function to:
-Triggers the ovary to extrude its ovum in peritoneal cavity
+Help penetrating the barriers protecting the ovum
-Help the fimbriated end of uterine tube to capture the ovum
-Lubricate the cervical canal by softening its Mucus
-Guard against entry of more than one sperm into the ovum

The process of sperm capacitation takes place inside the
-Ovum
-embryo
-tests
-male urethra
+female genital tract

What is the result of the cortical reaction?
-The corona radiata forms
-The zona pellucida forms
-sperm can now enter the egg
+Sperm can no longer enter the egg
-Acrosomes are removed.

The zona pellucida plays an important role in
-producing amniotic fluid
-formation of the prochordal plate
-neural crest migration
-Embryonic blood production
+preventing premature implantation

A 22-year-old woman is in her 3rd week of pregnancy. Which best describes the condition of the embryo?
-Gastrulation is complete, resulting in two germ layers.
+Neurulation is nearly complete.
-The embryo is resistance to teratogens.
-The trophoblast is present, but syncytiotrophoblast has not yet formed.

Which of the following correctly describes the germinal period?
-From fertilization until the end of the 2nd month
+First two weeks after fertilization
-From the 3rd month until birth
-Last trimester of pregnancy

What is the usual site of fertilization in the female reproductive system?
-Uterus
-Ovaries
+Lateral 1/3 of the fallopian tube
-Cervix

What occurs during the capacitation of spermatozoa?
-Sperm becomes immobile
-Sperm loses its acrosomal cap
+Sperm gains the ability to penetrate the egg
-Sperm divides into two

Which phase follows the penetration of the zona pellucida?
-Acrosomal reaction
-Fusion of oocyte-sperm cell membranes
-Capacitation
+Cortical reaction

What is the result of the fusion of the male and female pronuclei?
-Formation of two separate nuclei
+Formation of the zygote
-Initiation of cleavage
-Determination of sex

What prevents polyspermy during fertilization?
-Capacitation
+Cortical and zona reactions
-Acrosomal reaction
-Cleavage

During which period does the majority of organ growth occur?
-Germinal period
-Embryonic period
+Fetal period
-Postnatal period
