The morula is formed during cleavage after:
-2 days of fertilization
+At the end of third day of fertilization
-4 days after fertilization
-7 days of fertilization

Implantation occurs at:
+1 week
-2 weeks
-3 weeks
-4 weeks

Implantation occurs normally in:
-Fundus of uterus
+Body of uterus
-Cervix
-Vagina

Most common site of abnormal implantation is:
+Uterine tube
-Ovary
-Peritoneal cavity
-Broad ligament of uterus

Which structure bounds the cells after fertilization as they compact to form the morula?
+Zona pellucida
-Corona radiata
-Pronucleus
-Inner cell mass

Regarding second week of pregnancy, one statement is NOT correct:
+Formed of ectoderm and mesoderm
-Formation of amniotic cavity and yolk sac
-Differentiation of trophoblasts into cyto- and syncytiotrophoblasts
-Formation of extraembryonic coelom

The two layers of extraembryonic mesoderm are called:
-Endoderm; Mesoderm
-Primary; Secondary
+Somatopleuric; Splanchnopleuric
-Mesenchyme; Parenchyma

A pregnant woman has disturbed ectopic pregnancy. What is the most common site of implantation in this case?
-Mesentery
-Ovary
+Uterine tube
-Vagina

At what location does the amniotic cavity develop?
-Between the cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast
-Within the extraembryonic mesoderm
-Between the endoderm and mesoderm
+Within the epiblast

At the end of week 2 of development (day 14), what is the composition of the embryonic disc?
-Epiblast only
+Epiblast and hypoblast
-Ectoderm and endoderm
-Ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm

The zona pellucida plays an important role in:
-Producing amniotic fluid
-The formation of the prochordal plate
-Neural crest migration
+Preventing premature implantation

The blastocele is a cavity... Finally, the blastocele forms:
-Urachus
-Cloaca
+Yolk sac
-Intraembryonic coelom
